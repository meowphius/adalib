      The Ada Generic Library: Linear List Processing Packages
                              ERRATA

Affecting the code:

Section 7.4.7, p. 132.  In the Implementation, replace the line
"return To_Be_Done;" by "return S2;"

This correction has been made in the source files on the diskette
(version 1.01 and later).


Affecting the documentation only:

Section 7.4.1, p. 126.  In the Time field, replace "order nm" by
order "nf"

Section 6.1.5, p. 45.  Replace the end of the first sentence by
"with the exception of Sort, Delete_Duplicates, Delete_Copy_Duplicates,
and Search."  Add a new paragraph at the end of the subsection:

   The time for Search is order kn, where k and n are the lengths of
   its arguments.  In practice this worst case behavior is seldom
   achieved; typically the time is linear in n."

Section 6.5.56, p. 110.  Replace Time field by "order knm".  Replace
where field by "k = length(S1), n = length(S2) and m is the average
time for Test.  (In practice this worst case behavior is seldom
achieved; typically the time is linear in n.)"

Section 7.4.29, p. 158.  Same correction as above.

Section 10.5.39, p. 224.  Same correction as above.
